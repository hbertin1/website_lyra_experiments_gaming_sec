# Gaming Security Experiments

This website is the homepage for accessing the resource related to our experiments concerning online game system security, aiming to better understand network-level cheating and seeking for detection techniques. 

## Objective of the 1st experiments 
The goal of this experiment is to validate the experimental environment that will be leveraged later.  The game leveraged is Unreal Engine's sample game: Lyra, which is a team shooter game. The aspects to evaluate are related to the playability and the smoothness of the game played in an online large scale environment, with players' location distributed around the world. This is to have a ground truth about the operation of the game before proceeding to planned modifications.
