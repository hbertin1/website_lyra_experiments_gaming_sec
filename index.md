# Gaming Security Experiments

This website is the homepage for accessing the resources related to the experiments conducted on online game system security, aiming to better understand network-level cheating and seeking for detection techniques. 

## First phase of the experiments
The goal of this experiment is to validate the online game leveraged for the experimentations. The game is Unreal Engine's sample game: Lyra, which is a team shooter game. The aspects to evaluate are related to the playability and the smoothness of the game played in an online large scale environment, with players' location distributed around the world. This is to have a ground truth about the operation of the game before proceeding to planned modifications.
