# Gaming Security Experiments

This website is the homepage for accessing the resources related to the experiments conducted on online game system security, aiming to better understand network-level cheating and seeking for detection techniques. 

## First phase of the experiments
The goal of this experiment is to validate the online game used for the experimentations. The game leveraged is [Unreal Engine's](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US?sessionInvalidated=true) sample game: [Lyra](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/lyra-sample-game-in-unreal-engine), which is a team shooter game. The aspects to evaluate are related to the playability and the smoothness of the game in an online, large scale environment. This is to have a ground truth about the operation of the game before proceeding to planned modifications.
